      In this assignment, I used two AI models, GPT-4o from Copilot and Gemini 2.0 Flash, to assist in writing the code. Both models were effective. Initially, I used them to quickly generate the content for <code>index.liquid</code>, focusing on fetching JSON data and implementing basic Tailwind CSS styles. For example, I entered the prompt "Render two different endpoints on your main HTML page and style them using Tailwind." Both models were able to generate the main content area HTML code. They also handled requests to change the file source without issues, although the resulting Tailwind CSS styles were not always aesthetically pleasing.

      Next, I used both models to optimize the website's styles and interactive effects, starting with Tailwind CSS. In some cases, Gemini did not generate complete code and only provided partial snippets, so I used GPT-4o to complete the task. Later, I modified the styles in the CSS file, using broad prompts to see what styles they would suggest, such as focusing on a dark theme and redesigning the navigation bar with special effects. Both models provided similar designs and styles, and their performance in designing the navigation bar was comparable.

      Overall, both AI models provided significant assistance in this assignment, although they also had some minor drawbacks. Sometimes, if the prompts were not precise enough, the generated code didn't change much. Generating or modifying small code blocks was also inconvenient; the entire code had to be run, which was less efficient than making manual changes. However, they were still helpful as problem-solving tools. In my experience, Gemini was faster and more intuitive for quick changes to small snippets, while GPT-4o excelled in style details and interactive effects. By combining these two tools, I was able to complete the assignment more efficiently and obtain solutions, achieving good results by fine-tuning the generated framework.
